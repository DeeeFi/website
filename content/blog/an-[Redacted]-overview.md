## What [Redacted] is

[Redacted] is a virtual city of general-purpose personal servers.

## Traditional ETFs

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other assets. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown in popularity as a means of investing since the mid-1990s due to their intraday liquidity and low transaction costs.

## What is a cryptocurrency ETF?

A cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the price of one or multiple digital tokens and consists of numerous cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin have been dominating headlines around the world for many months. A surge of new crypto ETFs have been launched to make it easier for investors to buy cryptocurrencies without the headaches, security risks and complexity of setting up and managing crypto wallets and keys.
