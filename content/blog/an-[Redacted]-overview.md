## What [Redacted] is

[Redacted] is a virtual city of general-purpose personal servers.

## Traditional ETFs

A cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the price of one or multiple digital tokens and consists of numerous cryptocurrencies.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown in popularity as a means of investing since the mid-1990s due to their intraday liquidity and low transaction costs. In general, ETFs track a specific index and are generally traded on exchanges. 

## What is a cryptocurrency ETF?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin have been dominating headlines around the world for many months. A surge of new crypto ETFs have been launched to make it easier for investors to buy cryptocurrencies without the headaches, security risks and complexity of setting up and managing crypto wallets and keys

## The [Redacted] future

In an Urbit world, your data is no longer trapped in a jumble of
proprietary servers. Your urbit is a permanent, versioned, typed
archive the size of your digital life. Even before you move your data
from a Web service to a local Urbit app, your urbit can drive your
account with an API or scraper.

And within Urbit, data is never locked inside apps. Imagine if you
could painlessly switch between Facebook and Google+, Asana and
Trello, Tumblr and WordPress. Not only does your urbit upgrade itself
and its apps automatically, you can "sidegrade" a running app to
another vendor without losing data.

Your urbit is also your digital identity. Along with your data
lifestream of media, messages and documents, it has the keys and
tokens to manage all your legacy Web services. It holds the keys
for your cryptocurrency wallets, so it can buy and sell for you.
(With one personal server to secure, not 17 different accounts,
you actually have the bandwidth to take security seriously.)

You still use network services. But instead of interacting with
the service provider's HTML UI, which phones home using
proprietary HTTP APIs, you interact with a third-party app on
your urbit, which talks to multiple service providers using
public, typed Urbit protocols. For example, your urbit runs a
single shopping app, which downloads catalogs and uploads orders.
This app is one store which sells everything in the world, with a
salesman who's 100% on your side and always has the best price.
Every computing experience is different when the UI is working
exclusively for the user.

Finally, your urbit is the hub for your network of connected
devices. Your smart thermostat, your wristband, your phone and
tablet, all run satellite urbits which talk securely to your main
urbit in the cloud.

## A chance for digital freedom

The promise of the personal server isn't just convenience.
General-purpose computing is magic. This magic must be in the
hands of all, not just those who can master Unix. The computer
is a bicycle for the mind. It's an open vehicle for exploration
and discovery. It's not a way to optimize ad delivery.

Urbit, as virtual city, is a platform that brings together all our
datastreams -- from emails to heartbeats -- in a way that we ourselves
control. Can we work together to match faces in photos, without
submitting to some panopticon in Mountain View? While the first step
in freedom is the right to be left alone, the second is the power to
form new intentional communities, to create and evolve a voluntary
definition of public space. We have no idea at all what people will
do with this power.

General-purpose computing is digital freedom. And today, a cloud data
center is the technically optimal locus of computation. The cloud is
always on, always available, never loses data. Hosts are sometimes
attacked; but they never intentionally tamper with their virtual
computers. The cloud can never be secure against a global adversary;
but most people don't have a global adversary. A single portable
platform provides "herd immunity" for the few who do need direct
physical control over their main computers.

Though even laptops are atrophying into mere browsers, mass-market,
general-purpose computing on the client side remains an endangered
species that must be protected. But on the server side, this species
has never even _existed_. There has never been anything like a
mass-market personal server. Why not?


## Where we are, what we're doing

Urbit is in feature freeze. It's a minimum viable product in
early beta. It still needs quite a bit of fit-and-finish work.
We certainly don't recommend it for end users or consider it in
any way secure. But it's fun to play with, if you're a hacker.

This summer, we're making the switch to an open and transparent
development and specification process. A system as unusual as
Urbit can't be invented in public. But it has to be finished and
maintained in public.

Additionally, we're creating an open political and economic process,
with a small, fixed-price public presale of Urbit address space. Join
us and help make this future actually happen.
